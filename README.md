# Hi, I'm Abhinav 👋

**AI/ML Engineer • Applied Researcher • Data Scientist**

I build intelligent systems that run in the real world — not just in a Jupyter notebook.

- 🤖 **PoseCorrect**: Real-time rehab assistant that watches human movement, understands it, and talks back using LLMs + vision + biomechanical knowledge.
- 💹 **Spectra**: Quantum+Transformer forecasting pipeline for stock index movement and options strategy planning.
- ☁️ **FluidCloud**: Decentralized personal cloud that splits, encrypts, and distributes your data across your own devices.

I work across:
- Multimodal AI (vision + motion + language)
- LLMs with retrieval (RAG, MCP, agentic pipelines)
- Time series forecasting (classical, deep, and quantum)
- Distributed / edge systems

### 🔬 What I'm focused on right now
- Building realtime movement understanding for personalized rehab coaching (PoseCorrect / LymphFit)
- Pushing low-latency financial prediction models for high-frequency use (Spectra)
- Designing privacy-first personal cloud infrastructure with no centralized server (FluidCloud)

### 🛠 Tech I use a lot
**AI / ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers, MediaPipe, OpenCV, Qiskit  
**Intelligence layer:** RAG, LangChain, FAISS, Knowledge Graphs, MCP  
**Backend / Infra:** Python, Rust, FastAPI, Flask, AWS (Lambda / Textract / S3), Docker  
**Other:** Time-series modeling, EMG signal analysis, realtime streaming
